Client(rqst) ->  "Event queue" holds all the requests coming from the client in a queue
                 |
                 "Event loop" handles the requests
                 | 
                 Request are of two types 
                        - "blocking" 
                        - "non blocking"
                    - Non blocking rqsts are executed easily and directly sends the response to the user after processing it

                    - blocking rqsts Go to the thread pool and it needs a thread to be assigned to it so that it can process the rqst and give back the response
                    - there is less scalability in blocking rqsts because there are only 4 threads (by default) available so it will be difficult to manage all the request because when one thread will get over another one will start
                    - but also you can increase the size of these default threads and it depends from machine to machine 
                    - it depends on the number of CPU cores in the server when you bought that server
                    - maximum that many threads you can have


So its a good practice to write non blocking rqsts
